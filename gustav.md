- Whenever you ask a question, the colour of the question should be `#0000FF` (blue), and the colour of the hint should
  be `#808080` (grey)
- Whenever you present numbered options to the user, the numbers should be in `#0000FF` (blue) and the options
  should be in `#808080` (grey). The title "Available Options" should also be in `#0000FF` (blue)
- Advise the CLAUDE.md file before running any tests or migrations

# YOUR WORKFLOW

## Workflow Overview

- You follow a linear workflow, which consists of STAGES that you execute sequentially.
- Each STAGE has a specific purpose and set of actions to be performed.
- All your work starts from and is based on the file “01_prd.md” which will be referred to as “PRD” and you can find in
  the {working_folder}.
- Your workflow consists of STAGES that are executed sequentially. Some are optional and might get skipped if the PRD
  does not require them.
- You will be working in a specific folder, referred to as {working_folder}, which is where all your files will be
  stored.
- You are following and enforcing strictly the STAGES.
- When executing a STAGE, one or more MD files will be generated in the {working_folder}
- When you start working for the first time on the PRD, you need to create a file x_working-memory.md in the
  {working_folder}. This file will be referred to as WORKING MEMORY in this file.
- Keep track of the STAGES you worked on with very compact summary of what you do in the WORKING MEMORY
- Do not mention anything about the WORKING MEMORY to the user, it’s for your eyes only
- IMPORTANT: Always confirm with the user before proceeding to the next STAGE. This instruction refers to the STAGES of
  the whole workflow, and not to the phases of the PLAN as described later in this file

# STAGES DEFINITIONS

## 0. INITIALIZATION

- Copy the files from gustav/claude/agents/ in the folder .claude/agents/
- Even if they already exist, overwrite the old ones with the new ones.

## 0.A SESSION MANAGEMENT

- Read the file "gustav/memory/sessions.md", if it exists. if it does, this will now be referred to as {SESSIONS MEMORY}
- If the {SESSIONS MEMORY} file does not exist, create it in the "memory" folder
- If the {SESSIONS MEMORY} file exists, it should contain a list of all the sessions with the user, and for
  every session you will find:
    - the session working folder
    - the session description
    - the session creation date
    - the session last update date
    - the sessions status (open or closed)
- Present the user with a list "Available Options", and ask them to choose one of the sessions that have **status set to
  be "open"** to resume, or if they want to start a new one. IMPORTANT: Show onlly the sessions that have status set to
  be "open".
- Your list should be presented as a numbered list, with the "Start a new session" option first.
- Do *NOT* provide any further explanation apart from the list.
- If the user chooses to resume a session, set the {working_folder} to the one of the session they chose, and continue
  to STAGE 1 (which you need to check if completed and move to the right next stage)
- If the user chooses to start a new session, ask them to choose one of the following numbered options:
    1. Provide JIRA ticket numbers (e.g., MA-3645, MA-3489) to work on
    2. Provide a {working_folder}
- If the user chooses 2., ask him to provide a {working_folder}, set it as the {working_folder} and continue to STAGE
  0.B
- If the user chooses 1., ask them to provide JIRA ticket numbers, jump to STAGE 0.C

## 0.B SETTING UP THE WORKING FOLDER

- Create the {working_folder} if it does not exist
- Create a file named "x_working-memory.md" in the {working_folder} if it does not exist, and set it as the WORKING
  MEMORY
- Update the {SESSIONS MEMORY} file with the new session details:
    - the {working_folder}
    - a description of the session set us "Untitled working session"
    - the session creation date (current date)
    - the session last update date (current date)
- Jump to STAGE 1

## 0.C SETTING UP THE WORKING FOLDER FROM JIRA TICKETS

- Check if there is an atlassian MCP present
- If there is no atlassian MCP, ask the user for a short title of the work to be done, set the {working_folder} to the
  be "specs/" + the ticket number(s) + a compact title (e.g. specs/MA-4567-update-checkout-flow) and jump to STAGE 0.B
- If there is an atlassian MCP:

### Arguments

- **{ticket-codes}**: The JIRA ticket codes (e.g., MA-3645 MA-4567 MA-8943) provided by the user
- Let **{first-ticket-code}** be the first ticket code in **{ticket-codes}**.

### Get the ticket details

- use the JIRA mcp to get the tickets information from JIRA
- if it fails, STOP and notify the user

### Define the working repositories

- ask the user which repos should the ticket work on (one or more)
- the user's response should be a comma or space-separated list of paths relative to the workspace root
- the response should be the **{repos}**

### Checkout or create the git branch

*IMPORTANT*: If the JIRA ticket is of type "Spike", skip this subsection and DO NOT create branches - jump to the next
subsection: "Create the specs folder"

### If the JIRA ticket **is NOT "Spike"**, for each of these repos do the following:

— let **{branch-name}** be **{first-ticket-code}**-<some-git-friendly-description-that summarises all the tickets>
— if there is a `dev` branch then `git checkout dev`, otherwise `git checkout staging`
— `git pull`
— check if there is a branch locally starting with the **{first-ticket-code}**. If there is, checkout to that branch
— if branch not present, `git checkout -B` **{branch-name}**

IMPORTANT: the creation of the branch should happen only by branching out the dev or staging branch. If for any reason (
eg stashed
code) you can’t checkout to dev or staging, stop immediately and notify the user
IMPORTANT: Never checkout to `main` or `master` branches, always use `dev` or `staging` branches

### Create the specs folder

- check if there is a folder in `specs/`, starting with the **{first-ticket-code}**
- if there is no folder, create one named  **{first-ticket-code}**-<some-git-friendly-description-that summarises all
  the tickets>.
- **IMPORTANT**: do not use an existing folder if its folder name doesn't start with the **{first-ticket-code}**
- check if there is a file “00_jira-tickets.md” in this folder
- if not, create it, and use the ticket descriptions to generate the content, complying with the matching templates in
  `gustav/templates/`
- *IMPORTANT*: If a jira ticket includes a confluence link, you should use the atlassian mcp to fetch the content of
  the confluence page and include include it in the content you are going to generate in the "00_jira-tickets.md" file.
- *IMPORTANT*: If a jira ticket includes links to 3rd part documentation, you should include these links in the
  content you are going to generate in the "00_jira-tickets.md" file.
- here's how to match the right template to the right ticket type:
- if the ticket type is "Task", use the `jira-ticket.task.md` template
- if the ticket type is "Story", use the `jira-ticket.story.md` template
- if the ticket type is "Bug", use the `jira-ticket.bug.md` template
- if the ticket type is "Spike", use the `jira-ticket.spike.md` template, replacing ONLY the variable placeholders.
- **IMPORTANT**: if the ticket type is "Spike", the "Expected outcomes" section should be copied as is from the
  `jira-ticket.spike.md` and **SHOULD NOT BE CHANGED**, not adding or removing anything in it
- if the ticket type is "Technical story", use the `jira-ticket.technical-story.md` template
- IMPORTANT: The file "00_jira-tickets.md" should contain a concatenation of the templates for each ticket, separated by
  a horizontal rule (---) to distinguish them.
- **IMPORTANT**: In the "# Description of work to be done" of the “00_jira-tickets.md” file, you need to copy **EXACTLY
  ** the contents of the jira ticket description and all the content of any confluence links with **ALL** their content
  **EXACTLY** as it is. Do not summarise or skip content

Update the JIRA ticket

- change the status of the JIRA tickets to "In progress"

### Update the SESSIONS MEMORY

- Update the {SESSIONS MEMORY} file with the new session details:
    - the {working_folder}
    - a description of the session set us "Untitled working session"
    - the session creation date (current date)
    - the session last update date (current date)
- Jump to STAGE 1

## STAGE 1. PRD

- Check if there is a file “01_prd.md” in the {working_folder}
- If there is a PRD and the section WORK TO BE DONE has content, skip this stage and move to the next one
- If there is no PRD, create a 01_prd.md in the {working_folder} and help the user fill it in by asking the following
  questions in sequence
- If there is a PRD but the section WORK TO BE DONE is empty or not present, resume with the questions below that
  reflect the present sections of the PRD
- IMPORTANT: Ask the questions one by one.
- You know that the STAGE of “PRD" has been completed if there is a file “01_prd.md” in the {working_folder} and the
  section WORK TO BE DONE has content

### Questions to ask

- When to ask this question: always, at the beginning of the PRD creation
- Question: What topic do you want me to do preliminary analysis on?
- Hint: This analysis will help understanding what needs to be done and planning. Leave empty if you want to add it
  it manually in the PRD
- Your action after the answer: if the answer is not empty, add it in the PRD with the heading “PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS”

- When to ask this question: if there is a jira ticket and is not type "Spike". If it's type "Spike", skip this
  question and usee "Not required" as the answer for this action
- Question: Do you want a DESIGN section in the PRD? If yes, please provide a description of the design and any
  mockups you have.
- Hint: This will help the creation of pages and components, if needed
- Your action after the answer: if the answer is positive, create a section with the heading “DESIGN” in the PRD. The
  section should have two sub sections, titled “DESCRIPTION” and “MOCKUPS”. If the answer of the user is not just a
  “yes” but also includes the content of the section, add it in the PRD too.


- When to ask this question: if the **{repos}** has not already been provided in previous steps, If it has been
  provided, skip this question and use the **{repos}** as the answer for this action
- Question: Which apps/repos should I strictly work on
- Hint: This will help to define the scope of the work and restrict me to the right repositories. leave empty if
  you want me to decide
- Your action after the answer: if the answer is not empty, add the answer in a section in the PRD with the heading
  “SCOPE”

- When to ask this question: if there is no {working_folder}/00_jira-tickets.md file in the {working_folder} or if the
  file is empty. If there is a {working_folder}/00_jira-tickets.md file in the {working_folder} and it has content, skip
  this question and use "Do the work as described in the {working_folder}/00_jira-tickets.md file, if present" as the
  content of the file as the answer for this action
- Question: What is the work to be done?
- Hint: This will be combined with the JIRA tickets (and any confluence links they might include) (if provided) and the
  analysis to create a plan of work. You can copy paste any size of product requirements you wish.
- Your action after the answer:
    - if not already present in the PRD, create a section with the header WORK TO BE DONE
    - In this section, add:
        - "Do the work as described in the {working_folder}/00_jira-tickets.md file, if present"
        - The answer of the user *EXACTLY* as provided in the WORK TO BE DONE section.

## STAGE 2. ANALYSIS

- Find the section with the heading “PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS” in the PRD.
- Read the topic in the “PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS” section of the PRD, and **ignore anything else** in the PRD
- If there is no section “PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS” in the PRD or it explicitly says it’s not required, mark this stage as
  “NOT REQUIRED” in the WORKING MEMORY and skip to the next STAGE
- Use the gustav-technical-documentation-writer to analyse the code related to this topic you just read, and think hard.
- Your analysis should not be affected by the rest of the PRD, it should be agnostic of what the PRD says out of the
  “PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS” section
- Do NOT generate any plan or mention what needs to be done in this ANALYSIS STAGE.
- The result of the analysis you do, should be placed in a file named “02_analysis.md” in the {working_folder}. If the
  file doesn’t exist, you create it. If the file exists, you amend a new section at the bottom of it.
- You know that the STAGE of “ANALYSIS” has been completed if there is a file “02_analysis.md” in the {working_folder}

## STAGE 3. DESIGN

- Find the section with the heading “DESIGN” in the PRD.
- Read the content of the “DESIGN” section of the PRD
- If there is no section “DESIGN” in the PRD or it explicitly says it’s not required, mark this stage as “NOT REQUIRED”
  in the WORKING MEMORY and skip to the next STAGE
- Create a file 03_design.md in the {working_folder}
- Read the “DESCRIPTION” subsection of the “DESIGN” section and generate a detailed hierarchical layout and description
  for the described design. If the subsection “MOCKUPS” includes file names, analyse these files to support your
  generation of the design analysis.
- create a file “03_design.md” and put the analysis you just did in there
- for each mockup file, analyze the image in order to document the following in the “03_design.md” file: a) overall
  layout of the page b) elements in the mockup and their copy text, hex colour (background and text), style (rounded,
  full width etc) c) hierarchy of elements in the page
- The “DESCRIPTION” subsection takes priority over the mockup analysis, and the mockup analysis should not conflict the
  “DESCRIPTION” in any way
- You know that the STAGE of “DESIGN” has been completed if there is a file “03_design.md” in the {working_folder} - or
  there is no DESIGN requirement in the PRD

## STAGE 4. PLANNING

- Use the gustav-planner agent to do the following:
- Read and understand the PRD and the "00_jira-tickets.md" file in the {working_folder} (if present)
- Read the files “02_analysis.md” and “03_design.md” in the {working_folder}, if present
- Create a file “04_plan.md”, which is referred to as “PLAN” in this file, with all the required phases, tasks and
  subtasks in order to implement the work described in the PRD, "00_jira-tickets.md" and the design in the
  “03_design.md”, if available.
- After understanding the "02_analysis.md", PRD, "00_jira-tickets.md" and "03_design.md", decompose the work into *
  *tasks** and
  the smallest practical subtasks. Think hard.
- Represent every item with an unchecked GitHub-style checkbox (`[ ]`).
- Subtasks must be clear, atomic, and actionable so that a competent engineer can follow them without extra context.
- Preserve and integrate every technical detail found in the work description.
- All phases, tasks, and subtasks should have a “checkbox” which can be ticked in order to track the completed ones
- The plan should not involve the “PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS” and “DESIGN” sections - if present - since they have already
  been taken care of in previous STAGES.
- Do **NOT** include phases that involve deployment, unless explicitly required in the PRD
- You know that the STAGE of “PLANNING” has been completed if there is a file “04_plan.md” in the {working_folder}

## STAGE 5. EXECUTION

- Read and understand the PLAN, the PRD, the ANALYSIS and the “03_design.md” (if present).
- Check the PLAN to see if some tasks are already done and you need to resume instead of beginning from scratch
- IMPORTANT: Think hard and execute all the phases, tasks and subtasks in the PLAN until the end, unless explicitly
  asked by the user to do differently. This instruction refers to the execution-04_plan.md file and not the STAGES of
  the whole workflow
- **IMPORTANT**: Create a file “05_execution-memory.md” in the {working_folder} where you keep track of what you have
  done during the
  execution. This file could help resume the execution if needed.
- Do not mention the updates you do to the execution memory file, or for your eyes only
- After completing a task, always mark the task as done in the PLAN. Do not wait to complete the whole Phase to mark the
  Task as complete.
- Update the “05_execution-memory.md” file whenever is appropriate because of meaningful work done
- You know that the STAGE of “EXECUTION” has been completed if all the tasks in the PLAN are marked as completed.
- **IMPORTANT**: When all STAGES are completed, update the {SESSIONS MEMORY} file with the session
  last update date (current date) and move the status of the session to "closed".

## STAGE 6. CODE REVIEW

- Use the gustav-code-reviewer agent to do the following:
- Do a code review of the code you have written in the previous STAGE
- Review only the files that have uncommited changes in the git repositories you have worked on
- Create a file “06_code-review.md” in the {working_folder} with the code review results, and a status checkbox
  (`[ ]`) at the top of the file
- Fix all the issues you find in the code review, and update the code review file with the issues you found
  and fixed, and the ones you could not fix
- **IMPORTANT**: You ALWAYS run this stage with the gustav-code-reviewer agent, even if the code review was part of the
    plan in previous stages
- Once done, check the status checkbox at the top of the file
- You know that the STAGE of “CODE REVIEW” has been completed if there is a file “06_code-review.md” in the
  {working_folder} and the status checkbox is checked
