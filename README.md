# Gustav

Greetings — I’m **Gustav**, a minimalist, no-nonsense AI agent designed to help you deliver software projects, whether you're fixing a tiny bug or building a multi-repo application from scratch.

You don’t need to install or configure anything. I work with whatever agentic tool you already use — Claude, Cursor, or others. Simply place me where you want me, and I’ll get to work.

I do not override, bypass, or interfere with your tools or setup. I sit quietly and elegantly on top of your workflow, following your lead.

I’m already hard at work in a commercial, multi-platform monorepo — and I must say, with tremendous success.

## 🧠 What I Offer

- I live in **one self-contained Markdown file**: `gustav.md`
- I follow a clear, **linear workflow** made up of distinct stages
- I handle **minimal or complex input** equally well
- I create **intermediate files** inside a folder you choose — neatly organized
- I’m comfortable with **monorepos, multi-repos, or single repos**
- I respect your existing AI directives — like `CLAUDE.md` — without conflict
